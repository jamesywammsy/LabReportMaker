Please download the 3 JLatexMath .jar files, as they are needed to display the formulas. We will figure out how to put this directly into the batch file in the final submission. 
For the batch file, please add :
start javaw -jar jlatexmath-1.0.7.jar
start javaw -jar jlatexmath-font-cyrillic-1.0.7.jar
start javaw -jar jlatexmath-font-greek-1.0.7.jar
